Drop-in replacements for MKPolylineRenderer and MKPolylineView with more customisation options.

Currently it is very simple and only includes drawing a differently coloured border around the line.

Can be used instead of MKPolylineRenderer or MKPolylineView. Adds the border by default. To change the colour supply the 'borderColor' property and the 'borderMultiplier' controls the width of that border.
